# Bugs

List of current bugs or correctness issues. Also an area for me to keep my rambling where what I want to add is not clear.

- [8-1-2026] Casting a fresh session from the device picker while local audio plays stops nothing locally: the picker creates the remote session without ending local playback, and the deck bar's precedence keeps the local face over the remote one (device_picker.dart around 313-356, precedence in deck_bar_host.dart around 80-91). Needs Connect's transfer semantics before deciding what "start there" should do to the local engine.

- [8-1-2026] Casting while radio plays transfers a dead item session: mirrorSessionId never clears when radio takes the engine, so the picker (reachable via the settings screen during radio) offers a transfer of a session whose queue the engine no longer plays (connect_controller.dart around 91-99). Same Connect-semantics dependency.

- [8-1-2026] A routed set-rate from another device is silently reset at every gapless boundary: adopt() re-applies the locally configured speed, overwriting the rate the remote controller set (playback_session.dart adopt path). Whether the routed rate should persist across boundaries is a Connect-semantics decision.
